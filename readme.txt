# Royal Gazette Job Hunter

## Making checking the Royal Gazette job board slightly easier.

This simple script by default checks the Royal Gazette Job board https://www.royalgazette.com/jobs/ and
tells the user whether any new jobs have been found or old ones removed since the last time the script was run.

Poetry for version management, so you just need to do a 'poetry install',
but in current form not really required as all you need are the requests and
beautifulsoup4 libraries.

Which you can install with pip via `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.

Then just run src/main.py
